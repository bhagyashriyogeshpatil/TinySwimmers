## Project Overview

### Project Objective

The primary goal of the Tiny Swimmers website for infants and toddlers is to provide parents with all the necessary information and guidance they need to ensure their young children have a safe, comfortable, and enjoyable swimming experience

The target audience for the Tiny Swimmers website would be parents or guardians of young children, typically infants and toddlers. These parents are likely interested in enrolling their children in swimming lessons to instill water safety skills from an early age.

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to know what the website is about.
- As a user, I want a clear and intuitive navigation menu so that I can easily browse different sections of the website.
- As a user, I expect to be greeted with a welcoming homepage that captures my attention and provides key information about the website.
- As a user, I hope to find a dedicated section on the website that outlines the different courses offered for infants and toddlers, including details such as age requirements, skill level, schedule and price.
- As a user, I want to easily register my interest in joining courses at the Tiny Swimmers website for infants and toddlers so that I can secure a spot for my child and begin their swimming journey.
- As a user, I expect to find a clear and intuitive registration process on the website, where I can easily provide my contact information and indicate my interest in specific courses.
- As a user, I want to check out the company social media profiles.

### Design

For a clear understanding of the purpose of the website, it was designed to have three pages such as Home, Courses and Register Page. To attract the attention of the target audience, a logo with a splash image, a favicon with a swimming cartoon and a hero image with two young girls swimming in a swimming pool are used.

Semantic markup was used to ensure a well structured page.

The blue color theme was chosen to match the swimming pool theme and the image on the homepage. Alice Blue #E9F9FF serves as the background color, providing a clean and minimalist backdrop for text and other elements. To distinguish navbar and footer from main content color Onahau #C2EFFE is used. 
![Color Palette](assets/images/readme-images/ColorPalette.jpg)

Media Queries were used to allow for the layout to adapt to all screen sizes maintaining the structural integrity of the website.

Poppins font from Google fonts was used throughout the whole website with a fallback to sans-serif.

### Validator Testing 
#### HTML Validator

- Each html file was validated using [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input).
- Initially, there were warning regarding  HTML headings structure and info about trailing slash on void elements. In the hero section, I adjusted the heading tags from h1 to h2. I removed the slashes from void elements across all three HTML files to ensure cleaner validation reports.
