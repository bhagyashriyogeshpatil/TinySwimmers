              <span>Developmental Benefits:</span>
              Early exposure to swimming can have positive effects on a child's
              cognitive and psychomotor development. It stimulates sensory
              experiences, enhances motor skills, and promotes spatial
              awareness, contributing to overall developmental milestones.

              <span>Family Bonding and Fun:</span>
              Swimming lessons provide valuable opportunities for parents and
              caregivers to bond with their infants and toddlers in a fun and
              supportive environment. It also introduces children to social
              interactions with instructors and peers, promoting social skills
              and cooperation

              <span>Lifelong Skill:</span>
              Teaching swimming at an early age establishes a foundation for
              lifelong water competency. Children who learn to swim early are
              more likely to continue swimming throughout their lives, enjoying
              recreational activities, water sports, and potentially even
              pursuing competitive swimming.
